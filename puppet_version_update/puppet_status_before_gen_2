We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System

    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
